# Reminders / What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2025/lab1.html) due Thursday 2024-01-30 at 9 AM to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
    - Here are the R packages I used to build my answer sketch for Lab 1, not counting the xfun package which I used only to present the session information.
        - broom, janitor, knitr, mosaic, naniar, rsample, simputation and tidyverse
2. Rosenbaum: Read Chapter 4 for our next class and skim Connors (1996) and Gum (2001)
3. It's not too early to start thinking about:
    - developing a [project proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2025/proj500.html) and identifying an available data set (initial draft due 2025-02-13)
    - claiming an [Observational Studies In Action](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2025/osia.html) article (due 2025-02-19)
4. Watch Lecture 3 when it becomes available.
