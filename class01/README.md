## 500 Class 01: 2025-01-16

Zoom class 1 will take place on Thursday 2025-01-16 from 10-11 AM. 

## What should I do to prepare BEFORE the first class session?

1. **Register for the course** through SIS. That will alert Dr. Love to get you set up to access the course materials.
2. Watch the recorded **Lecture 1** RCTs and Observational Studies; A Motivating Example when it becomes available in January.
3. **Buy the book**. During the course, we will read Paul Rosenbaum's book **Causal Inference**, which is available as an e-book or in paperback for under $15. Please buy the book and get started reading it as soon as you can. Ideally, you'd read through Chapter 2 before our first class.
4. Once you have registered for the course, please visit our [Welcome to 500 survey](https://bit.ly/500-welcome-2025). You'll need to log into Google via CWRU to access the survey, which should take about 10 minutes to complete. Please complete the survey as soon as possible.
5. **Download the software**. Install R and RStudio and some necessary R packages on a computer you can control throughout the semester. Details [are available here](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2025/software.html).
6. Read Benson and Hartz 2000 from [Sources](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources)
