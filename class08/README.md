## Announcements

1. Remember that we do not have class on Thursday 2025-03-13, due to Spring Break.
    - I will be away and not responding to email from 2025-03-07 through 2025-03-14.
    - Spring Break is an excellent time to work on your OSIA presentation, and get going on the remaining elements of the Project.
2. Lab 4 is due to Canvas at **8 AM** on Thursday 2025-03-20.
3. Our next class, Class 9, will be our first **in-person** class. We will start at **9:05 AM** and run until 11:15 AM in Wolstein Research Building, room 1217. Parking is *always* an issue near the CWRU Campus. Leave time to get to class by 9, if at all possible.
    - Classes 9-11 will not be broadcast on Zoom. I will try to record them.
    - Classes 12-14 will neither be broadcast nor recorded, since that causes problems with project presentations. Sorry.
4. At Class 9, our main activity will be the [first few OSIA presentations](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-classes-2025/tree/main/osia). We will also discuss Lab 4, Rosenbaum through Chapter 8, and perhaps look at [Elbadawi (2021)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Elbadawi%202021.pdf) and this [Supplement for Elbadawi 2021](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Elbadawi%202021_supplement.pdf).
5. The OSIA schedule for Class 9 includes Katie, Ajay, Trisha and Dana as first readers, then JiaWei, Tatchaporn, Sarah and Logan as second readers.
    - First readers (Katie, Ajay, Trisha and Dana): Submit final versions of the slides for your class presentation (18 slides should be a reasonable maximum) to our Shared Google Drive **by 1 PM** on the day before your presentation, so **Wednesday 2025-03-19**. The file name should include your name. The folder you want in our Shared Drive is called **OSIA Slides for First and Second Readers on 2025-03-20 (Class 9)**.
    - Second readers (JiaWei, Tatchaporn, Sarah and Logan): Submit final versions of your 2-4 slides for your presentation to our Shared Google Drive **by 7:30 AM** on the day of your presentation, so **Thursday 2025-03-20**. Be sure the file name includes your name. We expect you to have reviewed the slides prepared by the First Reader (posted the day before) in preparing your materials. The folder you want in our Shared Drive is called **OSIA Slides for First and Second Readers on 2025-03-20 (Class 9)**.

## Key Ideas from Rosenbaum, Chapter 6 (from postscript)

> Sensitivity analysis addresses small pre-treatment differences that we cannot see, but of course the differences might be large, not small. Perhaps large differences that we cannot see leave behind visible traces that we can see. An invisible mouse may pass unnotices, where an invisible elephant leaves a path of wreckage. Quasi-experimental devices, such as multiple control groups, are tools for discovering large unmeasured pre-treatment differences between treated and control groups when such differences are present.

## Key Ideas from Rosenbaum, Chapter 7 (from postscript)

> Random assignment of treatments is sometimes unethical or infeasible, but bits of randomness enter every life, altering its course. Natural experiments, discontinuities, and instruments are attempts to cull bits of natural randomness for constructive use in an observational study.
