## Evaluation Form

The evaluation form for today's presentations will be found at <https://bit.ly/500-projects-class-13>. 

- It's a Google Form, and you must be logged into Google via your CWRU account.
- Please open the form and use it to provide comments on each of the presentations.
- You may skip your own presentation, and (if you're Tatchaporn, Anika or Olivia) you can also opt to skip the presentation immediately before yours.
- Please remember to hit submit at the end of the form (after all four presentations) before you leave this room. Thank you!

## Reminders

- Final Project Submissions are due to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) at **9 AM on Monday 2025-04-28** from everyone regardless of when you give your project presentation.
- Projects to be given in Class 14 (2025-04-24: our last session) are those by Sarah, Dana and Kelly. The three of you need to submit your Project Abstract and Slides by **noon on Wednesday 2025-04-23** to our Shared Google Drive. Look for the folder called **Project Abstracts and Slides for Class 14 (2025-04-24)** on our Shared Drive. Within that folder, you should find a subfolder with your name - place your slides and abstract there. If you have any last-second slide changes, then you can submit those to the same place by 8 AM Thursday, and I'll make sure those are the ones on screen in the room.
- When prompted via email by the University (usually in late April), please visit <https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/> and complete the course evaluations before they close.
