## Key Ideas from Rosenbaum, Chapter 8 (from postscript)

> Replication is central to science, but it is easy to use the same procedures to repeat the same mistakes. A series of observational studies may reach firmer conclusions than any one study in that series, providing successive studies are liable to different mistakes, not to repeating the same one. Evidence factors seek such replication within a single study through carefully varied comparisons.
