## Today's Agenda

1. Introduction (first class in person)
2. Observational Studies in Action - schedule **to come**
3. Discussion of Lab 4 - the sketch for Lab 4 will be posted to our Shared Drive **by class time**
4. Discussion of Rosenbaum **Causal Inference** through Chapter 8 (Replication, Resolution and Evidence Factors)
5. Some Key Takeaways from Elbadawi 2021 [Contemporary Revascularization Strategies and Outcomes Among Patients With Diabetes With Critical Limb Ischemia](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Elbadawi%202021.pdf) with [Supplement](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Elbadawi%202021_supplement.pdf): Insights from the National Inpatient Sample. *JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions*, 14(6): 664-74. doi:10.1016/j.jcin.2020.11.032

## Key Ideas from Rosenbaum, Chapter 8 (from postscript)

> Replication is central to science, but it is easy to use the same procedures to repeat the same mistakes. A series of observational studies may reach firmer conclusions than any one study in that series, providing successive studies are liable to different mistakes, not to repeating the same one. Evidence factors seek such replication within a single study through carefully varied comparisons.

## Reminders for Next Week

2. Next week, we will continue Observational Studies in Action - schedule **to come**.
3. For next week, complete reading Rosenbaum **Causal Inference** through Chapter 9 (Uncertainty and Complexity in Causal Inference)
4. Skim Posner et al. 2001 [Comparing Standard Regression, Propensity Score Matching, and Instrumental Variables Methods for Determining the Influence of Mammography on Stage of Diagnosis](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Posner%20et%20al%202001%20Comparing%20Methods%20in%20a%20Mammography%20Study.pdf) *Health Services & Outcomes Research Methodology*, 2: 279-290. doi:10.1023/A:1020323429121
