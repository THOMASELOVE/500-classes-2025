## Today's Agenda

1. Comments from Dr. Love on the [Project Update](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2025/proj500.html#the-project-update)
2. Observational Studies in Action - schedule **to come**
3. Discussion of Rosenbaum **Causal Inference** through Chapter 9 (Uncertainty and Complexity in Causal Inference)
4. Some Key Takeaways from Posner et al. 2001 [Comparing Standard Regression, Propensity Score Matching, and Instrumental Variables Methods for Determining the Influence of Mammography on Stage of Diagnosis](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Posner%20et%20al%202001%20Comparing%20Methods%20in%20a%20Mammography%20Study.pdf) *Health Services & Outcomes Research Methodology*, 2: 279-290. doi:10.1023/A:1020323429121

## Key Ideas from Rosenbaum, Chapter 9 (from postscript)

> Replication is central to science, but it is easy to use the same procedures to repeat the same mistakes. A series of observational studies may reach firmer conclusions than any one study in that series, providing successive studies are liable to different mistakes, not to repeating the same one. Evidence factors seek such replication within a single study through carefully varied comparisons.

## Reminders for Next Week

1. Next week, in class 11, we will conclude our Observational Studies in Action presentations - schedule **to come**.
2. For next week, skim Lehr et al. (2020) [The impact of change in definition of increased-risk donors on survival after lung transplant](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Lehr_2019_extra.pdf) *J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg* 160(2): P572-581. ([full text](https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(19)33064-8/fulltext)) DOI:10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.10.154
3. Next week will also be our final opportunity to ask and answer questions about the Project before our presentations begin in Classes 12-14.
