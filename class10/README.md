## Key Ideas from Rosenbaum, Chapter 9 (from postscript)

> Replication is central to science, but it is easy to use the same procedures to repeat the same mistakes. A series of observational studies may reach firmer conclusions than any one study in that series, providing successive studies are liable to different mistakes, not to repeating the same one. Evidence factors seek such replication within a single study through carefully varied comparisons.

## Reminders for Next Week

1. The OSIA schedule for Class 11 includes Sarah, Anika, JiaWei and Logan as first readers, then Ajay, Trisha, Olivia and Kelly as second readers.
    - First readers (Sarah, Anika, JiaWei and Logan): Submit final versions of the slides for your class presentation (18 slides should be a reasonable maximum) to our Shared Google Drive **by 1 PM** on the day before your presentation, so **Wednesday 2025-04-02**.

Be sure the file name includes your name. We expect you to have reviewed the slides prepared by the First Reader (posted the day before) in preparing your materials. The folder you want in our Shared Drive is called **OSIA Slides for First and Second Readers on 2025-04-03 (Class 11)**.
2. For next week, skim Lehr et al. (2020) [The impact of change in definition of increased-risk donors on survival after lung transplant](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Lehr_2019_extra.pdf) *J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg* 160(2): P572-581. ([full text](https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(19)33064-8/fulltext)) DOI:10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.10.154
