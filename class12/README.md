## Evaluation Form

The evaluation form for today's presentations will be found at <https://bit.ly/500-projects-class-12>. It's a Google Form, and you must be logged into Google via your CWRU account. Please open the form and use it to provide comments on each of the presentations. You may skip your own presentation, and (if you're JiaWei, Logan or Catherine) you can also opt to skip the presentation immediately before yours. Please remember to hit submit at the end of the form (after all four presentations) before you leave this room. Thank you!

## Reminders

- Final Project Submissions are due to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) at **9 AM on Monday 2025-04-28** from everyone regardless of when you give your project presentation.
- Projects to be given in Class 13 (2025-04-17) are those by Trisha, Tatchaporn, Anika and Olivia. The four of you need to submit your Project Abstract and Slides by noon on Wednesday 2025-04-16 to our Shared Google Drive. Look for the folder called **Project Abstracts and Slides for Class 13 (2025-04-17)** on our Shared Drive. Within that folder, you should find a subfolder with your name - place your slides and abstract there. If you have any last-second slide changes, then you can submit those to the same place by 8 AM Thursday, and I'll make sure those are the ones on screen in the room.
