## Reminders

1. Draft 2 of your [Project Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2025/proj500.html#the-project-proposal) is due at 9 AM next Thursday 2025-02-27.
    - A summary of each first draft (with some comments beyond those on Canvas) is in the Project Proposals Draft 1 for 500 Google Sheet on our Shared Drive.
    - Warning: Be prepared. In the Zoom meeting on 2025-02-27, each of you will give a 2-3 minute talk (no slides) in which you will briefly describe the title, population, outcome, treatment and covariates included in your second Project Proposal draft. Be prepared to specify where the data come from, and how you sampled it (or plan to sample it), as well as any collaborators you are working with.
    - In this second draft, you'll address any issues I raised in my review of your first draft, to the extent possible. Most of you will be able to get by with minor changes. If I've posed something which you are unable to address, you should at least raise that issue as a potential limitation when writing either the study objective, the planned methodology, or in both places.
    - I believe you all have your data, so that you can fill in details you might not have had earlier about precisely what your inclusion/exclusion criteria will be, precisely how your outcome (which should be quantitative, binary or time-to-event for this project) and exposure (remember you must have a minimum of 100 subjects in each exposure group) will be defined. If not, we hope you'll at least have more information for the "Getting the Data Set" section.
    - I am willing to entertain projects with either one or two outcomes, and with one binary exposure (A vs. B, not A vs. B vs. C). If you suggested more than two outcomes or more than one split into exposure groups in your initial draft, we want to see a final decision on these issues.
    - I want to see a more comprehensive list of covariates you will include in your propensity score model, in particular, and we want to see some logic behind why these are covariates - things knowable and measured before the decision to receive the exposure happens, and (definitely) which pre-date the outcome.
2. Read Connors (1996) and skim D'Agostino Jr (1998), each found on our [Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources).
3. In Class 7, we'll be talking about sensitivity analysis. A relevant spreadsheet and associated documentation are now available on our Shared Drive. The recording for Class 7 is now available, with the link in the usual document on our Shared Drive.
